# Asing

## Overview

This project aims to address the issue of stunting in Indonesia by developing a machine learning model capable of classifying food into categories of 'worthy' or 'unworthy' for consumption by pregnant women. The classification will be achieved using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically leveraging a pre-trained MobileNet V2 model, implemented with TensorFlow and related libraries.
